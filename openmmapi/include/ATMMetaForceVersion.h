 * This is a plugin of the OpenMM molecular simulation toolkit                *
 * (https://openmm.org) that implements the Alchemical Transfer Potential     *
 * for absolute and relative binding free energy estimation                   *
 * (https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07894). The work is supported by a grant from  *
