The plugin interface is based on the [openmmexampleplugin](https://github.com/peastman/openmmexampleplugin) by Peter Eastman.

The design of the Meta-Force follows closely the implementation of OpenMM's CustomCVForce by Peter Eastman. Peter Eastman guided much of the developemnt of this plugin. See OpenMM's issue [#3045](https://github.com/openmm/openmm/issues/3045) for an account.
